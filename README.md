# wonders-of-the-world
This will my hackathon submission for the GitHub Code Innovation Series, it is in a form of a website about the 7 Wonders of the World. This will include a slideshow with images, links to information of each wonder of the world, where I have summarised information about each location.

This website is done with Bootstrap Studio and GitHub Pages which are both part of the GitHub Student Developer Pack.

Hope you enjoy this website! All web pages are interconnected
